 ABOUT SEER Seer is developing technology to revolutionise the diagnosis and management of neurological conditions, with a special focus on epilepsy. Our mission is to deliver deep personalised clinical insights and advance patient experience with leading-edge technology. Our technology consists of wearable devices, a cloud platform and machine learning systems. These systems are at the core of our at-home video EEG monitoring and diagnostic service - the first of its kind. Seer has already made a big impact across the east coast of Australia over the last 2 years, and is now building for international expansion. ABOUT OUR PRODUCT We're building a web platform to power wearable and implantable devices that are about to enter the healthcare market. The platform stores and manages the biomedical data from these devices, allowing us to provide personalised insights, predictions and alerts to patients in real-time. The platform currently supports our at-home EEG-ECG diagnostic services and will soon support clinical trials of devices carried out by partner companies. ABOUT THE ROLE Our web/mobile product team is growing and weâ€™re looking to hire another fullstack JavaScript developer to help us develop new capabilities and features. These features will allow patients to better understand their data, allow clinicians to quickly follow and track their patients condition, allow our clinical staff to easily manage referrals and patient data, our data scientists to curate and build upon de-identified patient data, and allow us to connect with physical devices for recording data.
