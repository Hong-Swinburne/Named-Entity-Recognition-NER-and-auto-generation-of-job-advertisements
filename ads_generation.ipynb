    "I have successfully tested the notebook in Python 3.7+, it should also work in other Python3.x environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a possible solution for generating job advertisement automatically with a pre-trained generative transformer model. Specially, this transformer model is a [GPT-2 model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) which is fine-tuned on the given meta information (e.g. job title, abstract, keyword etc.) related to the job ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training, validation and test corpus used in this use case are ads containing the words *machine learning*, *data science/scientist*, *AI* and *artificial intelligence* in the job description of provided JSON file. Note that due to the time limitation, I did not go through the whole 50,000 ads and specially pick all well-written and concise ads out of these ads. But this solution may be used to assist advertisers to automatically generate new better written, concise ads, if we carefully prepare such a training corpus to \"teach\" the model what well-written and concise ads look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "I followed [this blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/conditional-text-generation-by-fine-tuning-gpt-2-11c1a9fc639d) to fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-2 on our own ads dataset. For more technical details, please refer to [\"Conditional Text Generation by Fine Tuning GPT-2\"](https://towardsdatascience.com/conditional-text-generation-by-fine-tuning-gpt-2-11c1a9fc639d)\n",
